## Phase 1

In this milestone, we implemented the basic gameplay features outlined in our initial development plan. We have basic collision between the player and the platform, as well as the movement and related physics implemented. The player can jump (and double jump) between the platforms, and can drop through if the “down” key is pressed. The player sprite flips based on the direction the player is facing, and the player can shoot or throw a projectile in that direction using F and P (these keybindings are subject to change).  We have also met the goals of adding assets such as textured geometry for the player sprites and implemented a test map. There are no drastic changes and all requirements for this milestone have been met so no update to the proposal is needed.

## Phase 2
In this phase, we've achieved substantial advancements by introducing new features and enhancing existing ones. Our efforts have led to the creation of a welcoming user interface with a tutorial, ensuring a smoother and more engaging start to the game. The addition of sprites for players and power-ups has injected life and character into the gameplay, while responsiveness and power-up functionalities have been fine-tuned for a more dynamic experience. We've also boosted the game's visual appeal through captivating parallax effects and a platform texture map, enriching the immersive environment. The inclusion of collisions between players and bullets/projectiles adds realism and strategy to the gameplay, while the implementation of key frame/state interpolation ensures seamless transitions, offering players a more polished and enjoyable gaming experience. There are no drastic changes and all requirements for this milestone have been met so no update to the proposal is needed.

## Phase 3
In phase 3, the major milestone was successfully implementing the Gun System, adding various weapons each supporting a unique playstyle and with their own sounds and animations. We integrated sound effects, UI elements for power-ups/weapons, and diverse art assets. In addition, we focused on map refactoring, creating visually appealing maps like Island, Jungle, Space, and Temple. Overall, we enhanced the user experience and quality of life, by introducing an enhanced main menu intro screen and added clickable buttons to allow players to choose between various maps. Furthermore, we added text to indicate when players are reloading and arrows to indicate when players are outside of the view along with satisfying victory screens. Lastly, we rebalanced and fine-tuned the gameplay by tuning the guns and powerups. All requirements for this milestone have been met, and no major changes are needed based on the initial proposal.

## Phase 4

In this final milestone, we integrated an external software library (GLText) for text rendering, allowing us to dynamically display key information such as lives, ammo count and current weapons through UI elements. On the visual front, we tackled platform art layout issues and fixed the player-winning screen to display the correct winner. There were improvements in stability with fixes for potential crashes related to mouse click handling. We also added a story to include some narrative in the game experience. In addition, we updated assets across menus, maps, and backgrounds refreshing the maps for more cleaner and aesthetically pleasing visuals. Some other rendering changes include an electric touch for powerups. Along with that we also implemented camera controls so that the camera focuses on winning player and follows it. Lastly, various balance changes were made to the guns and powerups while also introducing an initial invincibility upon player respawning to ensure fair and balanced gameplay.
